# JAVASnakeGame
A simple Snake game implemented in JAVA.

Prints the playing field using ASCII after every move.
No time constraints in between moves -- currently being refitted to output training data for an artificial neural network to teach it how to play snake (only about as well as I can and no better, if implemented perfectly and there are enough training samples).
