# JAVASnakeGame
A simple Snake game implemented in JAVA.

Prints the playing field using ASCII after every move.

TODO:
- add time constraint between moves
- finish wall collision detection
- accept last character of a multi-char movement input
- print neural network inputs and output to csv file

Currently being refitted to output training data for an artificial neural network to teach it how to play snake (only about as well as I can and no better, if implemented perfectly and there are enough training samples).
